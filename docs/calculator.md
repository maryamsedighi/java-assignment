# Challenge #2 – Calculator
## What should it do?
It should allow the user to specify a calculation and get the correct answer.
For example, the user may specify “2 + 2” and their correct answer is “4”.
The user can continue with the math, like specifying “- 3” and the answer should be “1”.

For CLI, consider providing basic instructions to the user to say what type of calculations are supported.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Accept a number, an operator, and another number, and provide the answer
- Allow the user to continue to perform calculations on the previous answer by appending another operator and number
- Allow the user to clear the current calculation to start over

## Extra Credit!
- Between number and operator can be space or not
- Support grouping of calculations with parenthesis
